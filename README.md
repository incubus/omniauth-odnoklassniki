# OmniAuth Odnoklassniki.ru

This is the unofficial OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Odnoklassniki.ru via OAuth.
To use it, you'll need to sign up for an [OAuth2](http://dev.odnoklassniki.ru/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=12878032) Application ID and Keys
on the [Odnoklassniki Developers Page](http://dev.odnoklassniki.ru/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=13992188).

## Basic Usage

    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :odnoklassniki, ENV['APP_ID'], ENV['APP_SECRET_KEY'], public_key: ENV['APP_PUBLIC_KEY']
    end

## Configuring
You can configure several options, which you pass in to the `provider` method via a `Hash`:

* `scope`: A list of permissions you want to request from the user. [Read the Odnoklassniki docs for more details](http://dev.odnoklassniki.ru/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=12878032)

For example, to get `VALUABLE_ACCESS` permissions:

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :odnoklassniki, ENV['APP_ID'], ENV['APP_SECRET_KEY'], public_key: ENV['APP_PUBLIC_KEY']
    scope: 'VALUABLE_ACCESS'
end
```
